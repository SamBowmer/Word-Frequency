Simple C++ program written by Sam Bowmer that reads data from a text file, counts the
frequency of each word and then outputs the 10 most frequent words

When the program is started it will ask for a file name, input the name and/or directory
location of the .txt file you would like to test

"test.txt" provided contains data for the program to read, however any .txt file should 
work
